Annotation coherence.

Given a sequence set that the model is assigning scores of function descriptions:

Descriptions of GO terms that annotate the entire sequence set should be scored higher than terms that do not annotate the entire sequence set.

Let $D_{S}$ be the GO term descriptions associated with sequence set S.

\[P(d \in D_{S} | S) > P(d \notin D_{S} | S)\]

\attribute*

Specificity preference.

Among terms that do annotate the whole set, the model should score more specific terms higher than less specific terms.

Let $t(d)$ be the depth of a GO term description $d$, and $\delta$ is an arbitrary depth.
\[P(d \in D_{S}, t(d) \geq \delta | S) > P(d \in D_{S}, t(d) < \delta | S)\]

\attribute*

Branch equality.

Among the most specific terms that annotate the whole set, descriptions from all three branches of GO should be scored equally.

Let $B_i$ be the ith GO branch, and $D_{S, B_i}$ be the descriptions associated with sequence set S that are in branch $B_i$.

\[P(d \in D_{S, B_i}, t(d) = \delta | S) = P(d \in D_{S, B_j}, t(d) = \delta | S)\]

\attribute*

Annotation robustness.

Any set of sequences that have the same exact set of GO descriptions in common should produce the same scores for those GO descriptions.

Let $S_i$ and $S_j$ be different sequence sets such that $D_{S_i} = D_{S_j}$.

\[P(d \in D_{S_i} | S_i) = P(d \in D_{S_j} | S_j)\]

%Commonality 
%
%Having a sequence in the set with a sequence that has no annotations in common with the rest of the set besides the root terms should change the scores to score only the root terms highly.
%
%Let $s$ be a protein sequence such that $D_{s} \cap D_{S} = \emptyset$.
%\[P(d \in D_{S} - D_{S, root} | S + s) = 0\]
%\[P(d \in D_{S, root} | S + s) = 1\]
